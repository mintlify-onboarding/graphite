<Note>
    This video references the old names for the Graphite CLI's commands. The naming scheme has changed as of V1.0.0, which was released on 2023-09-13. The legacy commands will still be functional, but the CLI will prompt you to use the new command names. We will eventually deprecate the legacy names in future versions.

    The rest of our documentation has been updated accordingly—we'll update the product tour soon!
