Unless otherwise stated, these features are all included in the [Graphite free tier](https://graphite.dev/pricing).

## Command line interface

The Graphite command line interface is often the first tool that users install when exploring how Graphite can power their workflow. The tool is similar to Arcanist, allowing users to stack their branches from the command line and push PRs directly to GitHub—without having to deal with the mess of changing branch dependencies, executing rebases, or resolving messy merge conflicts.

Under the hood, the CLI is just invoking a series of git commands—mostly automating and combining commands we know you'll need.

Installing the CLI is easy.

## Customizable pull request inbox

We know how important it is to stay up-to-date with your own and your teammates' pull requests: the more informed you are, the faster you can ship code.

The Graphite PR inbox functions similarly to an email inbox—you can see all of the pull requests that need your review, have been returned to you, are waiting for review, and more. You can customize your inbox "sections" using a combination of pre-filled and boolean filters, and drag sections in the left panel or main app to rearrange their order.

## A "code-first" pull request page

At Graphite, we believe the code is the most important part of a pull request. With that in mind, we built our pull request page around the code rather than keeping all of the important information behind tabs.

## Insights

With Insights, you can create, save, and share custom views that query the review statistics of specific members or teams in your organization. Regardless of a person's role at a company (IC engineer, manager), everyone benefits from seeing metrics around the way they review code.

## Customizable meme library

The most important part of code review is definitely the memes (duh). Import your own memes into the customizable Graphite meme library, and use / aliases to include them in your comments as you're reviewing code.

## Notifications

Receive Graphite notifications in the app or in Slack.

Graphite's actionable Slack notifications are meant to be actionable and insightful—and like the CLI, can be used independently. After installing the Graphite Slack App on your Slack workspace, you can configure the types of events that you will receive notifications for in Slack.

The configurable Slack notifications include code changes in the Slack thread, the ability to approve, comment or request changes directly from Slack, and other important actions on the PRs you're involved in.

## Graphite Merge Queue (paid tier)

Merge queues help increase the velocity of your team's ability to push code by automating merges into your trunk branch. In addition to this, the Graphite Merge Queue honors the dependencies between PRs in a stack (which is already ordered), using our fast-forward merge strategy where dependent PRs are validated and processed in parallel.

Reach out to schedule a demo or trial of the Graphite Merge Queue.

## Sync
Sync allows you to use Graphite even if others on your team don't. Your Graphite account connects to your GitHub account and continuously syncs every pull request, comment, and reaction—instantly and securely.

## VS Code extension
The Graphite Visual Studio Code extension simplifies `git` operations, state, and workflows, and packages the power of Graphite into a friendly UI.
