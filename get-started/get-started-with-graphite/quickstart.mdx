description: "In this quick start, you will clone a new repository, use the Graphite CLI to create and manage PRs, and visualize and review changes in the Graphite web app."

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of GitHub and `git`.
- The Graphite CLI is installed and authenticated.

## Clone a repository

After you've successfully installed and authenticated the Graphite CLI, you can use gt commands to install and manipulate repositories and their data.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with a README so you can create, merge, and visualize new PRs. For this tutorial, we'll use a sample repository called `gt-quick-start`:

```perl
$ gt clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>
Passing command through to git...
Running: "git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>"

Cloning into 'gt-quick-start'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```

Note that the output includes the statement _"passing command through to git..."_

`gt` passes unrecognizable commands through to git so you can run commands like `gt clone`, `gt add`, and `gt status` even though they aren't native commands in Graphite.

2. Enter the newly cloned repository.

```perl
$ cd gt-quick-start
$ gt log
Graphite has not been initialized, attempting to setup now...

Welcome to Graphite!
